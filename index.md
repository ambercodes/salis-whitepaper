# Salis Whitepaper

Welcome to the official whitepaper of **Salis** — a decentralized care platform designed for sovereign health systems, built on the Cardano blockchain.

Salis empowers care seekers, providers, and communities through:

- A self-funded ADA wallet for health
- A non-tradable care token ($SALIS) earned through real contributions
- Trust-gated provider verification and booking
- Community-led DAO governance
- Mutual aid, gifting, and care equity infrastructure
