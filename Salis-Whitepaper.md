# SALIS Whitepaper

**Salis** — a constructed sacred word rooted in ancient Latin. It echoes *salus* (health and well-being), *sal* (salt, the essence of life and preservation), and *salve* (to heal or soothe). Though not a classical term itself, Salis carries a purposeful synthesis of these origins — symbolizing the regenerative, reciprocal energy of care, both given and received.

---

## Section 1: Introduction

**Salis** is a decentralized care economy built on Cardano, designed to empower individuals to take control of their health by rewarding care — not compliance. Rather than mimicking traditional insurance models, Salis introduces a sovereign, community-governed system that values both Western and holistic health practices equally.

---

## Section 2: The Problem

The current healthcare system is exclusionary, bureaucratic, and often punishes the uninsured. Freelancers, Alternative Healing Providers, and Seekers of Holistic Wellness are left out. Existing tools like FSAs and HSAs are limited to state-approved services and exclude many valid forms of healing.

---

## Section 3: The Salis Solution

Salis flips the system. It’s not an insurance provider — it’s a sovereign health commons that:

- Uses Cardano-native wallets and smart contracts  
- Enables decentralized governance through a DAO  
- Rewards real acts of care with $SALIS tokens  
- Offers a curated, community-trusted provider network  

---

## Section 4: Who It’s For

Salis serves:

- Self-employed individuals  
- Alternative and Spiritual Practitioners  
- Root cause and Somatic Therapists  
- Healing seekers outside traditional systems  
- Parents, Birth Workers, and Midwives  
- Mutual-aid-minded Communities  
---

## Section 5: System Overview

Salis has five integrated components:

1. **Wallet & Smart Contracts** – Users connect with a Cardano wallet to manage funds and book care.  
2. **$SALIS Token** – A non-tradable utility token used for reputation, rewards, and governance.  
3. **DAO Governance** – Decisions are made by the community with sovereign participation.  
4. **Provider Network** – Verified through community trust, not just state licensing.  
5. **Treasury & Reserve Pool** – ADA-backed pool for sustainability and emergency care.  

---

## Section 6: Token Design – $SALIS

$SALIS is:

- Non-tradable to avoid speculation  
- Earned through giving or receiving verified care  
- Used to access offerings, vote, and verify providers  
- Minted progressively through trust milestones  

**Trust gates include:**

- Completing verified sessions  
- Earning endorsements  
- Participating in governance  

---

## Section 7: How Salis Works – User Flow

**For Members:**

- Join and connect wallet  
- Fund care wallet (ADA)  
- Choose a provider  
- Complete session  
- Earn $SALIS for feedback, referrals, or governance  

**For Providers:**

- Join and label as “New Provider”  
- Get verified after 3 unique sessions  
- Receive ADA directly  
- Earn $SALIS progressively  

**For DAO Participants:**

- Propose or vote on updates  
- Stake $SALIS to signal trust  
- Influence treasury decisions  

---

## Section 8: Provider Verification & Integrity

Provider entry is:

- Open, but labeled as “New”  
- Verified after 3 unique client sessions  
- Upgraded through community endorsement  
- Tracked via public Care Profile  

No provider is favored by credential type. All trust is earned equally. Disputes are resolved through mediation, not bureaucracy.

---

## Section 9: Governance Model

Voting is sovereign:

- Members may delegate their vote, but can revoke at any time  
- Participation is gently required via platform soft-gates  

**Sovereignty Participation Logic:**

- Minimum 20% proposal response per moon cycle  
- If unmet, voting is required before continuing certain actions  
- Once met, voting becomes skippable  

---

## Section 10: Treasury, Yield & Sustainability

The treasury is ADA-backed:

- Funded by staking yield  
- 5% platform support fee funds infrastructure, contributors, and the DAO  
- Used for equity care pool, emergency funds, and provider rewards  

---

## Section 11: Care Access, Equity & Emergency Support

We offer:

- Sliding-scale contributions  
- Equity pool for financial hardship  
- DAO-triggered emergency support  
- Seasonal care rounds  

---

## Section 12: Technology, Tools & Future Potential

**Built on:**

- Cardano blockchain

---

## Section 13: Token Lifecycle & Minting Logic

- Minted for real care (session + validation)  
- Unlockable in tiers: Session → Verification → Endorsement → Governance → Legacy  
- Spent on community offerings
